Front- and backend solutions for creating and showing patient information. The app lists patients and by clicking the name, one can examine patient information in more detail. Adding new patient through a form is made possible. The emphasis has been in learning typescript both in front- and backend. Types, interfaces, interface extensions and enums are used both in front- and backend. Backend utilizes type narrowing for proofing input data
